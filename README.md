## Abstract

This project analyzes 120+ years of Olympic history (1896-2016) combined with Paris 2024 athlete data. We explore three research questions: (1) gender participation trends over time, (2) predicting national medal counts using regression, and (3) classifying athlete success based on biometric features.
