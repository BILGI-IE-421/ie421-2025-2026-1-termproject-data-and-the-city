## Abstract

This project analyzes 120+ years of Olympic history (1896-2016) combined with Paris 2024 athlete data. We explore three research questions: (1) gender participation trends over time, (2) predicting national medal counts using regression, and (3) classifying athlete success based on biometric features.

## Research Questions

**Q1 - Gender Parity Analysis:** How has female participation evolved in the Olympics from 1896 to 2016, and what is the current state at Paris 2024?

**Q2 - Medal Count Prediction:** Can we predict a country's total medal count using delegation size and historical performance? (Multiple Linear Regression)

**Q3 - Athlete Classification:** Do biometric features (age, height, weight) predict medal success in high-physicality sports? (Logistic Regression)
